[AdapterFusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00247) is a learning algorithm that combines task-relevant information contained within [adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00751) to fine-tune a target task using multiple resources.
We employ AdapterFusion on a classsic Arabic NLP problem, *Dialect Identification*, and deploy the resulting model on HuggingFace SpacesðŸ¤—

<sub>_**This project is a fraction of a Msc degree dedicated to Arabic Dialect Identification that was supervised by [Prof. Dr. Mervat Abouelkhair](https://github.com/mervatkheir)**_</sub>

### Requriements for Fusion:
- An AdapterFusion model requires *N* adapters
-  Each *n* adapter is fine-tuned on task-relevant data
- In our case, we fine-tune, we fine-tune a total of *8* adapters on the data below covering MSA/DA, Region, Country and Province Levels
- For each diatopic variation an AdapterFusion (AF) model is created, hence AF for each Region, Country, Province and MSA/DA
- We share one of the best performing AF models on Regional Dialect Identification here: [HuggingFace SpacesðŸ¤—](https://huggingface.co/spaces/nehalelkaref/RegionClassifier)
