# AdapterFusion for Arabic Dialect Identification ðŸ¤–

[AdapterFusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00247) is a learning algorithm that combines task-relevant information contained within [adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00751) to fine-tune a target task using multiple resources.
We employ AdapterFusion on a classsic Arabic NLP problem, *Dialect Identification*, and deploy the resulting model on HuggingFace SpacesðŸ¤—
