# AdapterFusion for Arabic Dialect Identification ðŸ¤–

[AdapterFusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00247) is a learning algorithm that combines task-relevant information contained within [adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00751) to fine-tune a target task using multiple resources.
We employ AdapterFusion on a classsic Arabic NLP problem, *Dialect Identification*, and deploy the resulting model on HuggingFace SpacesðŸ¤—

<sub>_**This project is a fraction of a Msc degree dedicated to Arabic Dialect Identification that was supervised by [](Prof. Dr. Mervat Abouelkhair)**_</sub>

### Requriements for Fusion:
- Typcially an AdapterFusion model requires adapters pre-trained on tasks relevant to a target task.
- In this case, a number of adapters tuned on dialect identification tasks




### Data and Domains:
